                <h2>Pros of Wind Energy</h2>
                    <p>The most obvious advantage of wind energy is that it is a renewable energy source and it creates no carbon emissions or other pollutants, but that is true for every renewable energy source. In spite of that, wind energy has its own unique adavnatages compared to other renewable energy sources. For example, wind energy is typically cost-effective compared to other energy sources because it has a low maintenance cost because turbines are self-sufficient. Additionally, wind turbines are flexible and can be installed individually or in groups (called wind farms) and in the ocean. On some occasions, the government can even pay landowners to install a wind turbine.</p>

                <h2>Cons of Wind Energy</h2>
                    <p>As you can imagine, there are far fewer cons of using wind energy than using a finite energy source like coal because there are no pollutants released into the air. However, there are still flaws to wind energy, one of which being the fact that it cannot be equally harnessed around the world due to the inability to build a large wind farm or the overall lack of strong wind speeds in certain areas. Additionally, in areas where there are both residents and turbines, residents often complain because the wind turbines create noise and visual pollution. Lastly, wind turbines can be a threat to wildlife especially birds due to the spinning turbine blades.</p>

                <h2>Cost and Efficency</h2>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier, wind turbines typically have a low maintenance cost and do not require workers present at all times, however there is a large upfront cost per turbine. Turbines typically fall between the price of $2-4 million and are about $50,000 every year in maintenance. However, on the bright side, one wind turbine can power about 1000-2000 homes in one year depending on the location and size of the turbine. At this rate, it will typically take about 15-20 years for a wind turbine to pay for itself.</p>
