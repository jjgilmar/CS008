                <h2>His Music</h2>
                <p>Kid Cudi mostly creates hip hop, alternative rock, and alternative hip hop, but in recent years has gotten more into progressive rap. The lyrics of his songs typically focus on personal problems with substance abuse, his life growing up, and mental health. This allowed Kid Cudi to be a voice for the unheard and for those with vulnerabilities, which sparked his popularity for the younger generation.</p>

                <p>However, because of his somewhat repetitive song structure and lyrics, Kid Cudi is often critiqued for being a lazy lyricist. Critics tend to focus on this aspect of his music and ignore the monumental changes to modern day hip-hop and rap music that Kid Cudi has created.</p>

                <p>In his own music, Kid Cudi has popularized a new style of R&B rap that is much more somber, emotional, and sometimes almost spiritual. To create this more emotional and spiritual style of rap, Kid Cudi used and popularized humming which can be seen in increasing amounts in recent hip-hop and rap music. </p>

                <p>Kid Cudi has also influenced other artists while working with them as a songwriter and producer. With each artist that he worked with, he left his own personal touches and flares within the lyrics and rhythm allowing him to leave a timeless mark on the music industry.</p>
